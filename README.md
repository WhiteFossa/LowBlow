# Project LowBlow - Advanced programmable cooler controller

Development is under progress, so no description now. But, to be told short, it's open hardware advanced cooler controller with next features:
- Self set-up to coller characteristics (minimal voltage, when cooler starts, minimal and maximal RPM);
- RPM loopback;
- Graphically configurable Temperature-RPM regulation curve.
