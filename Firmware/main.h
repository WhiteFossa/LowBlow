#include "hal.h" /* HAL */
#include <avr/eeprom.h> /* EEPROM utilities */

/**
 * EEPROM STRUCTURE
 *
 * We have 128 bytes of EEPROM
 *
 * First 2 bytes (word) - ADC base level (ABL) AKA base temperature, in ADC code. Temperature values are relative to this base value.
 * MN_LOOKUP_ABL_ADDRESS points to EEPROM address of ABL.
 *
 * Then - base RPMs, 1 byte, i.e. RPMs at base temperature. Obviously it can't be "off", so actual base RPMs is this value + MN_BRPM_INCREMENT.
 * MN_LOOKUP_BRPM_ADDRESS points to it.
 *
 * Then, temperature/RPM lookup table follows. Each lookup packed into 1 byte as follow:
 * RRRRTTTT, where RRRR is 4-bit RPM delta, and TTTT is 4-bit temperature delta.
 *
 * Temperature delta can't be 0, so actually we have TTTT+1, i.e. 0000 means 1.
 *
 * MN_LOOKUP_FIRST_VALUE_ADDRESS points to EEPROM address of the first lookup value.
 *
 * When looking up for RPM for given temperature the next algorithm is used:
 * 1) Declare RPM and Temperature variables;
 * 2) If temperature < ABL, then RPM = 0 and exit;
 * 3) RPM = Base RPM, Temperature = ABL (ADC base level);
 * 4) EEPROM address points to the first lookup table byte;
 * 5) If measured temperature <= Temperature, then return RPM and exit;
 * 6) Read lookup byte, parse it, RPM += RPM delta; Temperature += Temperature delta + MN_LOOKUP_TEMPERATURE_INCREMENT;
 * 7) Increment EEPROM address;
 * 8) Goto 5.
 *
 * Temperature here is the ADC value, and RPM is the argument of mn_set_rpm_in_percents() function.
