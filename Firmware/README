I. Building

This firmware was created with Eclipse + AVR Plugin. So, to build it you need Eclipse + AVR Plugin + working AVR toolcahin.
You can build two different versions of this firmware - one with 2.56V ADC reference and another with 1.1V ADC reference.

By default firmware will built with 2.56V reference, to switch to 1.1V uncomment #define USE_LM35_SENSOR in hal.h.

You can find already built firmware in Release directory.

II. Flashing
Fuses settings are in FUSES file.
Firmware can't be flashed with fully assembled circuit - you have to desolder one capacitor before flashing/solder it back before use. Consult with the README in Hardware directory.
